About Us

History

The International Societal Non-Profit Association for the Further Advancement of Wide Spread Usage of Hot-Pink for Websites and Similar Official Publication or "ISNPAFAWSUHPWSOP" was founded in 2017 by Erik Hacker in order to encourage companies and other oranizations to use the colour "Hot Pink" (hex: #ff69b4) in advertising, websites, logos and other official representation of the organization.

What We Do
